title: How to compute Equal Error Rate (EER) on ROC curve
---

Receiver operating characteristic(ROC) curve is "a graphical plot that illustrates 
the performance of a binary classifier system as its discrimination threshold is varied" 
(see [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic)).

[scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/) has nice functions to draw ROC curve and to compute the area under the ROC (see [here](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/model_evaluation.html#roc-metrics)). But currently there is no function to compute the Equal Error Rate (EER) on ROC curve.

After some thoughts, I have the following one-liner in Python:

```python
from scipy.optimize import brentq
from scipy.interpolate import interp1d
eer = brentq(lambda x : 1. - x - interp1d(fpr, tpr)(x), 0., 1.)
```

where `fpr` and `tpr` are the output of function [`roc_curve`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.roc_curve.html#sklearn.metrics.roc_curve)
