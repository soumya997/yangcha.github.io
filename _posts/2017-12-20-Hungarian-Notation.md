When I started programming in C/C++, one particular variable naming convention, [Hungarian notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_notation), is pretty popular. Even nowadays it is still being used. But based my experience, I found out that it is very annoying. Here are some reasons I am against it:

* Nowadays IDE could easily identify the variable's type. So encoding the variable's type into name becomes redundant. 

* It makes it harder to use the autocomplete feature of C/C++ IDE, which is indispensable for me to program.

* It makes it harder to perform code refactoring.
