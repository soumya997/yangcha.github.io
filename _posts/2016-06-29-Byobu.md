title: Nohup, Screen and Byobu
---

When I run a program on remote Linux server, I used to run it in background with `nohup` such as:

```bash
nohup my_app > log.txt &
```
It works well until some programs need user input from keyboard such as password. So I turn to [GNU screen](https://www.gnu.org/software/screen/). It is a window manager that multiplexes a physical terminal between several processes with sockets. Now I can access the terminals remotely, just like the [Microsoft Remote Desktop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_Desktop_Protocol), but only much faster since all communications are in text format.

One of the drawbacks of `Screen` is that it is not so intuitive. For example, there is no status in default settings. So I switched to [Byobu](http://byobu.org/), an enhancement for the GNU Screen or [tmux](http://tmux.github.io/). A nice introduction of Byobu can be found [here](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Byobu) and command lists [here](https://gist.github.com/jshaw/5255721).
